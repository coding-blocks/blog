## BOSS Experience

I am very much attracted towards the open source world. I love this concept that anyone from anywhere can contribute to a project and help others. 

Last year, I heard about GSoC and applied for it but failed to get into it. So I wanted to get into GSoC this year. Keeping this into my mind I applied for it. I gave my best to improve my proposal but the result was same 'Failed again'.

I wanted to utilize my summer by working on a real world project. Then I came to know about BOSS through [this](https://github.com/tapasweni-pathak/SOC-Programs)

------------------------------------------

**Bountiful Open Source Summer**

It's an open source summer program just like Google Summer of Code, RGSoC, Season of KDE and many others.

And the best part is that it is open to all Indian students. Any student can start participating into it without any registration or selection process.

One can take up any open issue and start contributing to it. By solving an issue the participant gets bounty which is used to determined the winners of this program. Prizes are there to keep motivating the students.

-----------------------------------------------------

I have contributed to several issues so far and I am enjoying this program very much. I got the chance to contribute to the codebase as well as the documentation.

It is a great option for those who didn't get into GSoC this year. Those who wants to get the taste of open source this is a great place to start with.
